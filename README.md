## Roadmap

[See the roadmap/todo file](ROADMAP.md)

## Changelog

### Latest: 4.3.1
- Removed blueprint code from index pages to make the loading faster
- Fixed a bug where new version number of the game were ignored

### Previous versions

Find the rest in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Contribute

Pull requests are always welcome, if you want a copy of the production or staging database for development purposes (meaning all emails and passwords will be randomized, I am not just gonna give away personal information to whoever wants them), just send me an email or open a ticket and we'll see to that.

### Setting up

Install ruby dependencies
```
bundle install
```

Install node dependencies
```
yarn
```

Then set up the database, either using docker or your own postgresql instance.
Once done, you can run the migrations and create the database:

```
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

If migrations are failing the first time, just re-run them again.

You should then be able to run the application:

```
rails s
```

### Seeding

The main thing you'll need to setup is to create a `Mod` for the blueprints. Currently there are 3 mods in production, 2 are legacy and one is for the base game. A `Mod` contains a field `version` which is a JSON like that:

```ruby
{
  "0.8.19.7662" => {
    "uuid4" => "0.8.19.7662-1627063708",
    "breaking"=>true,
    "created_at"=>"2021-07-23T18:08:28.644+00:00"
  }
}
```
`breaking` is used for the display of blueprints compatibility from one version of the mod / game to another.
You can also go in lib/tasks/mod.rake and have a look at the tasks, those tasks were used to seed the mods in staging and production:

```
noglob rake 'mod:fetch_base_game_latest[0.8.19.7662]' # Forces a game version to be added
noglob rake 'mod:fetch_base_game_latest' # Fetches the latest game versions from the Steam News API
noglob rake 'mod:flag_breaking[Dyson Sphere Program, 0.8.19.7662]'
```
The task rake mod:fetch_latest used to be to retrieve MultiBuild version from the Thunderstore API but we don't need it anymore.

### Environment

For proper development, you also will need a `.env` file at the root of the project. It needs to have the following environment variables:
```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=XXX
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
AWS_S3_ACCESS_ID_KEY=XXX
AWS_S3_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY=XXX
AWS_S3_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=dyson-sphere-blueprints
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_URL=https://XYZ.cloudfront.net
```
Most of those are not needed to be able to work on most features, but if you want images to display and be able to upload images for instance you will need to setup an AWS S3 and Cloudfront.
An example can be found in `.env.sample`

### Build development environment

You can also build a development environment with docker compose.

Using the `docker-compose.yml`, will start the following services:
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- AWS S3 (localstack)
- SMTP (mailhog)

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

to connect each service, use these credentials:
- PostgreSQL
  - User: `dev`
  - Password: `password`
  - Host: `127.0.0.1`
  - Database: `dspblueprints_development`
- Redis
  - URL: `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`
- AWS S3
  - Access key: `XXX` (some non-empty string)
  - Secret key: `XXX` (some non-empty string)
  - Region: `eu-west-1`
  - Bucket: `dyson-sphere-blueprints`
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:4566`
- SMTP
  - SMTP Server: `localhost:1025`
  - HTTP Server: `localhost:8025` (You can see the emails you have sent with WebUI)

The above configuration is written in `.env.sample`.
You can simply copy it and it should be enough.

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

### Rake tasks

There are a few rake tasks that you can use:
```
rake mod:fetch_base_game_latest[PATCH] # creates a new version in the DB, use like this: rake 'mod:fetch_base_game_latest[0.8.19.7662]'
rake blueprint:recompute_data # updates all blueprints summary if you have made any changes to it
rake mod:fetch_latest # currently legacy, but fetches the latest versions of all mods handled (MultiBuild and MultiBuildBeta)
```
